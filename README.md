# avoid-overlap

Utilities for chart-makers to avoid text overlaps in their graphics. The utilities were build with [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) and [React](https://react.dev/) in mind but likely work with other frameworks.

Note: This package is under development. The API is very likely to change! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/kevinschaul/avoid-overlap/issues) with any feedback.

## Two techniques to avoid overlaps: Nudge and Choices

Labeling charts, maps and other graphics is more art than science, but there are some general rules we can follow to achieve good results programmatically. This library provides two label-avoidance techniques: `nudge` and `choices`.

The `nudge` technique resolves overlaps by simply nudging labels away from each other until they no longer collide. You can limit the nudging to specific directions and distances. This technique works well if the thing youâ€™re labeling is an area rather than a specific point.

The following images, from [a Washington Post graphic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-chatbot-learning/), demonstrate the `nudge` technique. The labels were passed to `avoid-overlap`, specifying that nudging the labels either down or to the right would work.

*After*

The `choices` technique resolves overlaps by trying a series of positions provided by the user until it finds a combination that works. This technique works well if some number of different positions might work, for example if you are using a leader line or arrow.

In the following example, the labels were passed to `avoid-overlap` with a list of functions that could draw the label and an arrow in different positions: to the top left, top middle, top right, bottom left, bottom middle and bottom right. The library tries these positions until it finds a combination that works.

After: ![Same chart with the overlapping labels rendered using one of the provided choices so they no longer collide](assets/example-choices-1.png)

## Usage

TODO

You'll pass in the parent Element, an array of label groups that define how to resolve overlaps, and global options.

```js
import { AvoidOverlap } from 'avoid-overlap';
import { select, selectAll } from 'd3-selection';

const parent = select('.chart');
const headers = selectAll('.label-header');
const subheads = selectAll('.label-subhead');

const avoidOverlap = new AvoidOverlap();

avoidOverlapNudge.run(
  parent,
  [
    {
      nodes: headers.nodes(),
      render: () => {},
      priority: 1,
    },
    {
      nodes: subheads.nodes(),
      priority: 2,
      render: (node, dx, dy) => {
        // Apply the nudge to the node
        const selected = select(node);
        const [x, y] = selected
          .attr('transform')
          .match(/([0-9]+)/g)
          .map((d) => +d);

        select(node).attr('transform', `translate(${x + dx}, ${y + dy})`);
      },
    },
  ],
  {
    includeParent: true,
  }
);
```

#### Options

TODO

| option | type | default | description |

+--------+------+---------+-------------+

| includeParent | boolean | `false` | Whether to consider the parent as part of the bounds |
| parentMargin | object | `{ top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0 }` | How much extra spacing to consider for collisions with the parent |
| maxAttempts | number | 3 | How many iterations to try finding collisions before giving up |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Development should happen on feature branches, which should be PR-ed into the main branch.

Releasing happens using the [release-please](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-please-action) GitHub action. The action handles versioning, changelogs and publishing the package to npm.
